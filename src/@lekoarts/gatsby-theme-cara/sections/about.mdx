## About

> I am an aerospace engineer but I love building websites as much as building rockets.

Developing a website is not rocket science. Yet through web development, I find a way to do something I love while creating value for businesses. <br />
While I have diplomas in engineering and business, I learned web-development by myself (the internet helped). Being mainly focused on the front-end part of things, I am getting better every day on back-end subjects.
